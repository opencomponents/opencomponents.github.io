## Quick Concept Reference

<div className="quick-reference">

### **Components**
Independent, reusable UI pieces with their own HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and optional server-side logic.

### **Registry**
REST API that manages component publishing, versioning, and consumption across your organization.

### **Library & CDN**
Storage system for published components with automatic static asset distribution via CDN.

### **CLI**
Command-line tools for component development, testing, and publishing workflows.

### **Consumers**
Applications, websites, or services that render and display OpenComponents in their user interfaces.

## Understanding the Ecosystem

OpenComponents creates an ecosystem where:

1. **👥 Teams develop independently** - Each team owns their components end-to-end
2. **🔄 Components are versioned** - Semantic versioning enables safe updates and rollbacks  
3. **🌐 Consumption is universal** - Any backend can render components via HTTP
4. **⚡ Performance is optimized** - CDN distribution and caching maximize speed
5. **🔒 Deployments are safe** - Immutable artifacts prevent breaking changes
