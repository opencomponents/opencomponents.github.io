# Building Components

Everything you need to create production-ready micro-frontends.

1. **Getting Started** – scaffold your first component and understand the project layout.
2. **Template System** – pick the right template (ES6, React, Vue, etc.) and learn compilation basics.
3. **package.json Structure** – required fields, `oc` manifest, and best practices.
4. **server.js** – add backend logic, data fetching, and helpers.
5. **CLI** – day-to-day commands for development and testing.
6. **Debugging** – diagnose issues locally and in production.
